# Tucker Davis + Lego Mindstorms NXT Connection

**This is an archived project.**

Uses lever inputs on a Mindstorms NXT brick (the “button” NXT input is a simple contact circuit; you can rig your own lever system by halving an NXT accessory cable and creating an open circuit lever with whatever components you have sitting around) to cue a Tucker Davis system epoch while recording neural data. Requires TDT OpenDeveloper. This is absolutely overkill – I recommend using an Arduino (or similar) instead, unless you’ll be using the NXT for something else as well (e.g. conveyor belt).
